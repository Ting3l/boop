\
### Usage:\
Just like the usual ping. But boop.\
\
```
PS C:\> boop\
\
Usage: boop [-t] [-a] [-n count] [-l size] [-f] [-i TTL] [-v TOS]
            [-r count] [-s count] [[-j host-list] | [-k host-list]]
            [-w timeout] [-RH] [-src srcaddr] [-c compartment] [-p]
            [-4] [-6] target_name\
\
Options:\
    -t             Boop the specified host until stopped.\
                   To see statistics and continue - type Control-Break;\
                   To stop - type Control-C.\
    -a             Resolve addresses to hostnames.\
    -n count       Number of echo requests to send.\
    -l size        Send buffer size.\
    -f             Set Don't Fragment flag in packet (IPv4-only).\
    -i TTL         Time To Live.\
    -v TOS         Type Of Service (IPv4-only. This setting has been deprecated\
                   and has no effect on the type of service field in the IP\
                   Header).\
    -r count       Record route for count hops (IPv4-only).\
    -s count       Timestamp for count hops (IPv4-only).\
    -j host-list   Loose source route along host-list (IPv4-only).\
    -k host-list   Strict source route along host-list (IPv4-only).\
    -w timeout     Timeout in milliseconds to wait for each reply.\
    -RH            Use routing header to test reverse route also (IPv6-only).\
                   Per RFC 5095 the use of this routing header has been\
                   deprecated. Some systems may drop echo requests if\
                   this header is used.\
    -src srcaddr   Source address to use.\
    -c compartment Routing compartment identifier.\
    -p             Boop a Hyper-V Network Virtualization provider address.\
    -4             Force using IPv4.\
    -6             Force using IPv6.\
```

Example:\
```
PS C:\> boop 127.0.0.1\
\
Booping 127.0.0.1 with 32 bytes of data:\
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128\
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128\
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128\
Reply from 127.0.0.1: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128\
\
Boop statistics for 127.0.0.1:\
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),\
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\
    Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms\
